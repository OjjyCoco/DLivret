> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note : DLivret relies on Ethereum mainnet contracts and has not yet been deployed to the mainnet. As a result, the website [DLivret](https://dlivret.vercel.app/) is currently non-functional. To interact with the DLivret contracts, we use a local mainnet fork with Hardhat as the project is in development process.
